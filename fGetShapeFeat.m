function shapeFeatVector = fGetShapeFeat(region)
% This function gets the shapeFeat descriptors from a binary region
%
% INPUT
%   - region: Image with a binary region to get the descriptors from. There
%   is ONLY ONE REGION IN THE IMAGE. The type of the image must be LOGICAL
%
% OUTPUT
%   shapeFeatVector: Vector with all the descriptors of the ShapeFeat.
%   These are:
%      Convex Area: Number of pixels of the smallest convex polygon that
%     contains the region.
%      Eccentricity: Scalar that specifies the eccentricity of the ellipse 
%     that has the same second central moments as the region. 
%      Perimeter: Number of points in the contour of the region.
%      Equivalent Diameter: Scalar that specifies the diameter of a circle
%      with the same area as the region.
%      Extent: Scalar that specifies the ratio of the pixels of the
%     region to the pixels in the bounding box around the region.
%      Filled Area: Number of pixels belonging to the region after filling
%     its possible holes.
%      Minor Axis Length: Length of the minor axis of the ellipse that has
%     the same second central moments as the region. 
%      Major Axis Length: Length of the major axis of the ellipse that has
%     the same second central moments as the region.
%      R: Ratio between the major and minor axis of the ellipse that has
%     the same second central moments as the region.
%      Solidity: Ratio between the area of the region and the Convex Area
%     of the region.
